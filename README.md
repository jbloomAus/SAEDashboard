# SAEDashboard

SAEDashboard is a tool for visualizing and analyzing Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) in neural networks. This repository is an adaptation and extension of Callum McDougal's [SAEVis](https://github.com/callummcdougall/sae_vis/tree/main), providing enhanced functionality for feature visualization and analysis as well as feature dashboard creation at scale.

## Overview

This codebase was originally designed to replicate Anthropic's sparse autoencoder visualizations, which you can see [here](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/vis/a1.html). SAEDashboard primarily provides visualizations of features, including their activations, logits, and correlations--similar to what is shown in the Anthropic link.

## Features

- Customizable dashboards with various plots and data representations for SAE features
- Support for SAEs in SAELens and other libraries
- Neuronpedia integration for hosting and comprehensive neuron analysis (note: this requires a Neuronpedia account and is currently only used internally)
- Ability to handle large datasets and models efficiently

## Installation

Install SAEDashboard using pip:
```bash
pip install sae-dashboard
```


## Quick Start

Here's a basic example of how to use SAEDashboard with SaeVisRunner:

```python
from sae_lens import SAE
from transformer_lens import HookedTransformer
from sae_dashboard.sae_vis_data import SaeVisConfig
from sae_dashboard.sae_vis_runner import SaeVisRunner

# Load model and SAE
model = HookedTransformer.from_pretrained("gpt2-small", device="cuda", dtype="bfloat16")
sae, _, _ = SAE.from_pretrained(
    release="gpt2-small-res-jb",
    sae_id="blocks.6.hook_resid_pre",
    device="cuda"
)
sae.fold_W_dec_norm()

# Configure visualization
config = SaeVisConfig(
    hook_point=sae.cfg.hook_name,
    features=list(range(256)),
    minibatch_size_features=64,
    minibatch_size_tokens=256,
    device="cuda",
    dtype="bfloat16"
)

# Generate data
data = SaeVisRunner(config).run(encoder=sae, model=model, tokens=your_token_dataset)

# Save feature-centric visualization
from sae_dashboard.data_writing_fns import save_feature_centric_vis
save_feature_centric_vis(sae_vis_data=data, filename="feature_dashboard.html")
```

## Advanced Usage: Neuronpedia Runner

For internal use or advanced analysis, SAEDashboard provides a Neuronpedia runner that generates data compatible with Neuronpedia. Here's a basic example:

```python
from sae_dashboard.neuronpedia.neuronpedia_runner_config import NeuronpediaRunnerConfig
from sae_dashboard.neuronpedia.neuronpedia_runner import NeuronpediaRunner

config = NeuronpediaRunnerConfig(
    sae_set="your_sae_set",
    sae_path="path/to/sae",
    np_set_name="your_neuronpedia_set_name",
    huggingface_dataset_path="dataset/path",
    n_prompts_total=1000,
    n_features_at_a_time=64
)

runner = NeuronpediaRunner(config)
runner.run()
```

For more options and detailed configuration, refer to the `NeuronpediaRunnerConfig` class in the code.

## Generate dashboards for SAEs from other libraries

You can generate dashboards for any SAE from SAELens or another library that is not in in the SAELens [pretrained_saes.yaml](https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAELens/blob/main/sae_lens/pretrained_saes.yaml) file as long as a correct arg is passed to `converter_name` in `NeuronpediaRunnerConfig`. See the [neuronpedia_runner.py](https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAEDashboard/blob/main/sae_dashboard/neuronpedia/neuronpedia_runner.py) file for more details, or ask on the [Open Source Mechanistic Interpretability Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/opensourcemechanistic/shared_invite/zt-2k0id7mv8-CsIgPLmmHd03RPJmLUcapw). If you write a good custom loader for another library, please consider contributing it back to SAELens!

## Configuration Options

SAEDashboard offers a wide range of configuration options for both SaeVisRunner and NeuronpediaRunner. Key options include:

- `hook_point`: The layer to analyze in the model
- `features`: List of feature indices to visualize
- `minibatch_size_features`: Number of features to process in each batch
- `minibatch_size_tokens`: Number of tokens to process in each forward pass
- `device`: Computation device (e.g., "cuda", "cpu")
- `dtype`: Data type for computations
- `sparsity_threshold`: Threshold for feature sparsity (Neuronpedia runner)
- `n_prompts_total`: Total number of prompts to analyze
- `use_wandb`: Enable logging with Weights & Biases

Refer to `SaeVisConfig` and `NeuronpediaRunnerConfig` for full lists of options.
